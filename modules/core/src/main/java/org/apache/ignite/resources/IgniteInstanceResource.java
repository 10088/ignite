/**
 * Annotates a field or a setter method for injection of current {@link org.apache.ignite.Ignite} instance.
 * It can be injected into grid tasks and grid jobs. Note that grid instance will
 * not be injected into SPI's, as there is no grid during SPI start.
 * <p>
 * Grid instance can be injected into instances of following classes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeTask}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeJob}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.lifecycle.LifecycleBean}</li>
 * <li>All closures and predicates that can run on grid.</li>
 * <li>{@link IgniteUserResource @GridUserResource}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Here is how injection would typically happen:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements ComputeJob {
 *      ...
 *      &#64;GridInstanceResource
 *      private Grid grid;
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * or
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyGridJob implements ComputeJob {
 *     ...
 *     private Grid grid;
 *     ...
 *     &#64;GridInstanceResource
 *     public void setGrid(Grid grid) {
 *          this.grid = grid;
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
