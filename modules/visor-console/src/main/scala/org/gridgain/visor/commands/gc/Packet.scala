 * +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 * | gc | Runs garbage collector on remote nodes.                              |
 * |    | If specific node is provided, garbage collector is run on that node. |
 * |    | Otherwise, it will be run on all nodes in topology.                  |

 *     gc "{-id8=<node-id8>|-id=<node-id>} {-c}"
 * }}}
 *
 * ====Arguments====
 * {{{
 *     -id8=<node-id8>
 *         ID8 of the node.
 *         Note that either '-id8' or '-id' can be specified.
 *     -id=<node-id>
 *         ID of the node.
 *         Note that either '-id8' or '-id' can be specified.
 *     -c
 *         Run DGC procedure on all caches.
 * }}}
 *
 * ====Examples====
 * {{{
 *     gc "-id8=12345678"
 *         Runs garbage collector on specified node.
 *     gc
 *         Runs garbage collector on all nodes in topology.
 *     gc "-id8=12345678 -c"
 *         Runs garbage collector and DGC procedure on all caches.
