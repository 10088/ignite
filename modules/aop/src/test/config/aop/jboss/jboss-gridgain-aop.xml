    Ignite aspect definition to be used with JBoss AS. Identical file called 'jboss-aop.xml'
    is already included into ignite-x.x.x.sar JBoss archive that is shipped with Ignite.
    However, when doing your own custom deployment, you will need to copy this file
    into JBoss 'deploy' folder to enable AOP-based grid-enabling with @Gridify annotation.
