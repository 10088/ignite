\section intro_sec Introduction

Client Library is a lightweight gateway to GridGain nodes. Client communicates with grid nodes via REST or TCP binary
protocol and provides reduced but powerful subset of GridGain API. Client allows to use GridGain features from devices
and environments where fully-functional GridGain node could not (or should not) be started.

To get started please take a look at <see cref="GridClientFactory"/>.

The examples are available in the examples/dotnet directory.
